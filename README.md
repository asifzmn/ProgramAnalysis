# ProgramAnalysis

This project is a hands-on practice on python static analyzer. Here the notebook "pylint_analyzer.ipynb" is used for general experimentation. First, we cloned a github repository containing implementation of python library algorithms. Then we ran pylint on the python (.py) files only. The generated reports are then extracted and visualized on the checker types.
Additionally a checker is implemented for detecting non-unique return values in the functions of a python module.
